It truly enhances the portability of E-mount cameras, giving users the means to capture spontaneous moments when on trips with a light and compact camera/lens combination."

The elements correct for curvature of field on the wide-angle side and spherical and chromatic aberration on the telephoto side for beautiful, accurate, high-contrast reproduction across the entire image."

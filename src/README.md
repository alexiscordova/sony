# **Introduction**
This is our standard front-end build stack, it incorporates a number of open source tools and applications to help streamline our development. At the core is Grunt.js. It has 2 main targets: 'deploy' and 'debug'. The idea being debug would run as a constant watch target and update files as they are saved. The deploy being a more robust build that concatenates and minifies javascript and css. Below is a list and the required terminal commands to get up and running as well as links to all associated libraries, plugins, and required frameworks (node, java & ruby). 

## **Build Tools**  
Assumes your environment already has a minimum of :  
*Node (v0.10.0) / NPM (1.2.14)   
*Java (1.6.0_37)  - required for yui compressor  
*Ruby (1.8.7) / Ruby Gems (1.8.24) - required for compass  

If you don't here's how to get those:  
* **Node.js** http://nodejs.org/  
* **Ruby** http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/  
* **Java** http://www.java.com/  

Many of these are installed and checked into the /src/ directory so you will not need to install all of these however the full install directions are here. You skip the plugins installs, but it is recommended to install docpad and grunt using the -g (global) flag. 


**Grunt.js** command line automation tool http://gruntjs.com/  
requires: **Node.js** http://nodejs.org/ 
```
#!terminal

$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

**Compass converts SASS / SCSS to CSS** http://compass-style.org/
requires: Ruby, Ruby Gems http://rubygems.org/pages/download
```
#!terminal

$ sudo gem install compass
```


## **To Run**

**Debug:** (default task) This rebuilds the debug directory, parses your .scss files into css. Runs JSLint to test for errors in your javascript files. Compiles Html Templates into Pages. 
```
#!terminal

$ grunt 
```
or
```
#!terminal

$ grunt debug
```
or
```
#!terminal

$ grunt build
```

**Deploy:** This does the same things as debug except it concatinates and minifies your css & javascript files and rebuilds the deploy directory.

```
#!terminal

$ grunt deploy
```
or
```
#!terminal

$ grunt build --deploy
```

**Docs: ** This rebuilds the docs directory. 
```
#!terminal

$ grunt docs
```

**Pages: ** This runs compile on all the pagebuild files that are generated by page builder (or by hand)

```
#!terminal

$ grunt pages
```

or for the deploy version in build/deploy/:

```
#!terminal

$ grunt pages_deploy
```


**All: ** This runs all 'clean' 'debug' 'deploy' 'docs' 'pages' and 'pages_deploy'
```
#!terminal

$ grunt all
```

### **Advanced:**
*All of the following accept --deploy to target the deploy directory it assumes debug*  
ie:
```
#!terminal

$ grunt task --deploy
```

**Pages: ** duplicate from above, for reference this also accepts --deploy

**Common: ** This compiles all of the global and shared script, css, etc
```
#!terminal

$ grunt common
```

*All of the following accept :module-name to focus the task onto a specific module//*  
ie:
```
#!terminal

$ grunt task:module-name
```

**Watch:**
This watches your source files and performs tasks specific to each filetype for the debug target. For instance if you change a js file it will run lint and copy your js files to debug. If you change a .scss file it runs compass... etc. 
```
#!terminal

$ grunt watch
```

**CSS: ** runs compass to compile .scss into css files (also re-compiles the responsive-modules.scss in common)
```
#!terminal

$ grunt css
```


**JS: ** copies the js files into the defer folder (or minifies them into the --deploy folder)
```
#!terminal

$ grunt js
```

**HTML: ** compiles the files from module/demo/*.jade into html files 
```
#!terminal

$ grunt html
```

**Assets:** copies everything from images
```
#!terminal

$ grunt assets
```

**Light: ** builds css js and demo jade files
```
#!terminal

$ grunt light
```

**Build: ** runs clean, assets, and light (js, css, and demo jade files)
```
#!terminal

$ grunt build
```

### **Even More Advanced!:  
most of these are used internally by the above tasks but many can be called on their \\n:  
**clean** clears build folder  
**jshint** checks all site js and json not in docs or **/libs/  
**lint** legacy alias for jshint  

not going into detail on these:

**copy**   
  :common_debug  
  :common_deploy  
  :module_debug  
  :module_deploy  
  :docs  

**compass**  
  :common_debug  
  :common_deploy  
  :module_debug  // wont work on own use css  
  :module_deploy // wont work on own use css  
  :docs  

**min**   
  :plugins  
  :require  
  :secondary  
  :defer  
  :polyfill  

**jade **  
  :docs  
  :pages  
  :build_debug  
  :build_deploy  


## **Folder Structure**
all the source is located inside src/packages/

src/packages/common/ includes all the global level code and assets

src/packages/modules/** includes all the module code

src/packages/modules/**/css - module specific scss

src/packages/modules/**/html - jade template

src/packages/modules/**/img - image assets

src/packages/modules/**/js - javascript

src/packages/modules/**/demo - example demos and layouts for each module, not used in production

src/packages/modules/**/demo/data example json files to compile the demo and layouts against

## **Page Templates**

### Intro to Jade template language

Jade is a template language, its based on HAML which is an abstraction of HTML.. unlike other template languages we've used this isn't HTML with extra template syntax mixed in, its a new syntax for HTML which also has some template logic. Think SASS but for html markup instead of CSS, it gets rid of brackets in favor of strict whitespace formatting. 

example:  

```
#!jade

html(lang="en")
  head
    title= pageTitle
    script(type='text/javascript')
      if (foo) {
         bar()
      }
  body
    h1 Jade - node template engine
    #container
      if youAreUsingJade
        p You are amazing
      else
        p Get on it!
```

outputs:  
```
#!html

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Jade</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      if (foo) {
        bar()
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Jade - node template engine</h1>
    <div id="container">
      <p>You are amazing</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>   
```

So the big things to notice:
* Closing tags are omitted
* White space is VERY IMPORTANT
* ID's and classes are very similar to jQuery selectors
* Parameters other than class and id are done with parenthesis

### Common Pitfalls 

**IE conditionals:** the comment hacks code doesn't parse nicely with jade, therefore i've pulled out 2 additional includes: one for fonts and one for the initial html declaration that will be vanilla html, you probably won't have these in your module code, but I included it here for documentation sake

**Multiple variable class names** If you need to add multiple classes that are defined through variables in your json file (or elsewhere) you will need to use multiple parenthesis sets one for each variable to parse:

jade:
```
#!jade

div.myclass.grid(class= data.classes1)(class= data.classes2)
```

Comment bug

If you have a single line comment before an else statement (and maybe kinds of statements) you might get an error

```
#!jade

//- This is a comment about the else if below
else if data.view == 'whoa'
```

```
#!terminal

SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
```

## The power of mixins

Jade mixins are super powerful for repeatable code

example
```
#!jade

mixin myhgroup(h1txt, h2txt, h3txt)
  hgroup.myclass
    h1 h1txt
    h2 h2txt
    h3 h3txt

section
  +hgroup("this is a h1", "this is a h2", "this is a h3")

section.somethingelse
  +hgroup("new header", "etc", "etc")
```


you can even use them to create re-usable containers:

```
#!jade

mixin mycontainer
  .container.myclass
    .grid.full-bleed
      .span6
        .box
          block

section.mymodule
  +mycontainer
    h1 my headline!
```

There's a bunch of them we've been putting together that you can include:

```
#!jade

include ../includes/jade-helpers.jade

```




## Master Page Template

```
#!jade

include ../../../common/html/jade-helpers.jade
doctype 5
include ../../../common/html/ieconditionals.html

head
  include ../../../common/html/head.jade

body
  +partial('module-package/html/your_module.jade', 'packages/modules/module-package/demo/data/default.json')}

  include ../../../common/html/foot.jade
</html>

```




## **Module Data**

To include data through the partial include function you can use an external json like so:

```
#!jade

e = {"locals":locals, "data":data('your-module-name/default.json')}
!{ partial('modules/module_test.html.eco', e) }

```

The JSON format for jade is very strict, to help avoid compile errors we're running jshint

Remember that valid JSON object keys and variable names are strings and require double quotes, everywhere. When in doubt check here: http://jsonlint.com/ 

To reference your data using jade variables are found the 'data' class

```
#!jade

!{ data.myvar }

if data.somevar
  h1 something 
else
  h1 something else

ul
for item in data.myarray
  li item

```

## **Javascript Bundles**

inside packages/common/js we've grouped some of the js together in separate bundles

/libs is intended for third party libraries like jquery and modernizr
/libs/polyfill for scripts that only get used on IE such as selectivizr 

/require for scripts that are required on every page at load time
/secondary / for scripts that are required on every page but not loaded immediately

In debug all the scripts will just get copied over 1:1

In deploy all scripts are minified and scripts within required & secondary will get concatenated into require.min.js and secondary.min.js respectively 

All js files except top level libs will automatically be written into pages with the js_foot includes.

## **Docco JS Documentation**
We're using [Doccoh](https://github.com/rozmiarek/doccoh) to create javascript docs automatically. Docco parses JS to pull out single-line comments and parse them using the markdown syntax. For example:


```
#!javascript

// Module Title
// ------------
//
// * **Module:** Module Name
// * **Version:** 0.1
// * **Modified:** 01/01/2013
// * **Author:** Joe Developer
// * **Dependencies:** jQuery 1.7+, Modernizr
//
// *Example Usage:*
//
//      $('#foo').moduleName({
//        'sampleOption': 'foo'
//      });

```

Much more about markdown syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and [here](http://greg.vario.us/doc/markdown.txt). 

## ** Migrating from build tools v0.1.0  to v0.2.0 **
delete your current build files

npm uninstall grunt -g
npm uninstall docpad -g

update node to v0.10.0
npm install grunt-cli -g

re-check out master

test your modules
check for images, I re-linked alot of them
update your README.md file
* describe your module
* document the data .json files and what your jade template expects / options / requirements / etc

don't add build back into the repo, it should be in gitignore now


## ** Troubleshooting** 

### **Data not rendering to template** 
make sure your json variables **do not** have dashes in their names. 

//The Good//
```
#!json
{
    "categoryTitle":"Television Home Cinema",
    "tabs": [
        {
            "image": "img/modules/subnav/subnav_tab_tv.png",
            "imageAltTxt": "Televisions Sub Category Image",
            "title": "Two-up Pane",
            "target":"two-up-pane",
            "outlink":false
        }
   ]
}
```

//The Bad//
```
#!json
{
    "category-title":"Television Home Cinema",
    "tabs": [
        {
            "image": "img/modules/subnav/subnav_tab_tv.png",
            "image-alt-text": "Televisions Sub Category Image",
            "title": "Two-up Pane",
            "data-target":"two-up-pane",
            "outlink":false
        }
   ]
}
```

//The Ugly//
```
#!json
{
    "Category-Title":"Television Home Cinema",
    "tabs": [
        {
            "image": "img/modules/subnav/subnav_tab_tv.png",
            "Image-Alt-Text": "Televisions Sub Category Image",
            "title": "Two-up Pane",
            "Data-Target":"two-up-pane",
            "outlink":false
        }
   ]
}
```

### **On build, you get this (or similar) error** 
```
#!terminal
Waiting...
Error: watch EMFILE
```

Most likely it's a OS-level issue and you should update your limit by running this:
```
#!terminal
launchctl limit maxfiles 2048 2048
```

## **Optional Helper Apps**

* **Image Optim** handy image compression tool http://imageoptim.com/
requires: Mac OSX
//NOTE: You should Disable 'Jpegrescan' in ImageOptim preferences, it tends to make jpegs 'progressive download' //

* **Livereload** monitors local file changes and reloads the browser http://livereload.com/
* **Charles web proxy** blocks cache, throttles loading to simulate slow connection speeds, monitors server responses, etc http://www.charlesproxy.com/

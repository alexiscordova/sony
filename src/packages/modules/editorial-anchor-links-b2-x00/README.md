#Overview
The Editorial Anchor Links is a row of buttons that resizes below a Primary Tout. It is used to link to sections lower on the same page,
and also as an indicator (as a sticky nav) of what section you're currently in. 

It should always be used in conjunction with a Primary Tout with the "p2-editorial-anchor-links" mode (see primary-tout-p1-d7).

The bar can accomodate anywhere from 2 to 6 buttons.

In mobile, if the buttons don't fit, the nav will use iscroll to make it scrollable sideways.

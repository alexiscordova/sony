IE10
- when clicking on hotspot shadow, the animation is whacked
- animation isn't superlatively fluid, shakes (maybe create it at size for ie10 instead of double size)

IE9
- OK

IE8
- hotspots appear early, before placed (probably due to relying on opacity to hide the hotspots initially, instead of a display or visibility setting)
- when screen is very short (with debug window open on small screen) and there is an overlay with top image (which renders offscreen when opened), iQ is interfering with the heigh of the overlay. 
  In other words, in IE, if the construct has an image, there should be a height applied before the image loads so that it displays properly.
- off-state for overlays has a delay

IE7
- hotspots appear early, before placed (probably due to relying on opacity to hide the hotspots initially, instead of a display or visibility setting)
- z-index issue with full size e1 layouts with text blocks
- when screen is very short (with debug window open on small screen) and there is an overlay with top image (which renders offscreen when opened), iQ is interfering with the heigh of the overlay. 
  In other words, in IE, if the construct has an image, there should be a height applied before the image loads so that it displays properly.

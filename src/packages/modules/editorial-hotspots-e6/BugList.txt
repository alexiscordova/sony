* Need to verify padding per the comp; there appears to be a little too much in the .middle node. Might have to tweak the margin bottom when a link is present vs not
* Enquire throwing errors on older IE w.o breakpoint support
* Certain corner placements of hotspots render the minified panel when there is enough room to render the bottom or top. Rarely but it happens.
* Percentages should be massaged a little when in small view; a couple of pixels to reflect the original spot more accurately


FF

* footer padding not being honored. Wrapper at 100% doesn't wrap around it's parent element.
* + characters on the hotspots off by a pixel, when in minimal mode, off by a few pixels in different places. No identified reason, since they are each abs pos.


SAF

* OK


IE10
---
* hotspot animations are odd, they appear to draw from 0 width, 0 height
* As with FF, footer padding not being honored. Wrapper at 100% doesn't wrap around it's parent element.

CHROME

* OK


IE9
---
* As with FF, footer padding not being honored. Wrapper at 100% doesn't wrap around it's parent element.


IE8
---
* Hotspots are squares, not circles (expected), otherwise OK


IE7
---
* Hotspots are abysmal, but function properly. Arrow indicators are off-kilter


IPAD
---
* breakpoint 767 is intended to fire on ipad, need to check what resolution the view is rendering, otherwise it's rendering in desktop adaptive mode


IPHONE
---
* Flicker when clicked in portrait mode (in simulator). This is happening because the page is short in the window; circumstantial, not a bug.

* OK
